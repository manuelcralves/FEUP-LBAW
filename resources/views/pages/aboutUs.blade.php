    <h2>What is StyleSwap?</h2>
    <p> For people that like to buy or sell designer clothes through auctions and enjoy incredible deals, 
        StyleSwap gives you an amazing experience while lets you browse through a vast array of items up for auction 
        as well as create your own so that you may find that piece of clothing that was missing 
        in your wardrobe or sell the one that was taking up the space for a generous amount.</p>
      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>We are a group of Software Engineering Students at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto.</p>
      <h2>Our goal?</h2>
      <p>We have one mission: helping you out in buying designer clothes or selling yours (which is technically two missions).</p>
