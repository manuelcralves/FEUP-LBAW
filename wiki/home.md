# StyleSwap

> For people that like to buy or sell designer clothes through auctions and enjoy incredible deals, StyleSwap gives you an amazing experience while lets you browse through a vast array of items up for auction as well as create your own so that you may find that piece of clothing that was missing in your wardrobe or sell the one that was taking up the space for a generous amount.
